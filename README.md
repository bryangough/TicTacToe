# TicTacToe

Developed with 2018.2.10f1

A small example of the Tic Tac Toe game.

Currently the AI acts randomly but extending AIEngine will allow you to create more cunning versions.

Co-op and AI vs is possible by cloning Player or AI Objects and dropping them into the Player 1 and Player 2 slots.

If publishing TictacToeGameplay must be added to the Build Setting. It's in TicTacToe/Scenes
